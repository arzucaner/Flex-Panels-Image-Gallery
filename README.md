# Flex Panels Image Gallery

---

## The JavaScript30 Challenge is a course that helps developers improve their JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects, each focused on a specific aspect of the language. The Flex Panels Image Gallery project is one of the projects in this course, and it teaches developers how to create an image gallery with dynamic, interactive panels.

In this project, use CSS Flexbox to create a responsive layout that allows the user to click on each panel to reveal more information and a larger image. JavaScript is used to handle the click event and add or remove CSS classes to trigger the animations and transitions.

Through a series of exercises and challenges, developers will learn how to use CSS Flexbox to create a dynamic layout that adapts to different screen sizes and user interactions. They'll also learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate CSS classes and properties, handle click events, and implement custom animations and transitions.

Overall, the JavaScript30 Challenge Flex Panels Image Gallery project is a great way for developers to improve their skills with CSS Flexbox and JavaScript animations. By completing this project, developers will gain valuable experience with layout design, user interaction, and front-end web development techniques.
